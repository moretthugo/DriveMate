DriveMate is a project designed to optimize and automate the management of drivers' work shifts at Dublin Bus.
Its goal is to improve scheduling efficiency, accuracy in work hour calculations, and overall work-life balance for professional drivers.

This repository represents the early prototype of the application, initially guided with the help of AI tools to scaffold the project structure.
The current version is a foundation that will be expanded with deeper manual coding and system design skills acquired through further study.
